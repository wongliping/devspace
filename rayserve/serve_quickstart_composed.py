class Summarizer:

    A class used to summarize text using a pre-trained summarization model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    translator : DeploymentHandle
        A handle to a translation deployment service.
    model : pipeline
        A pre-trained summarization model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.

    Methods
    -------
    summarize(text: str) -> str
        Summarizes the given text and returns the summary.
    
    async __call__(http_request: Request) -> str
        Asynchronously handles an HTTP request, summarizes the text, and translates the summary.
